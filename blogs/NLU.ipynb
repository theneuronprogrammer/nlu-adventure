This allows a form of training-computation-cost-sharing so that low-resource users can reuse pretrained models without having to train them from scratch. These models are accessed through a simple and uniﬁed API that follows a classic NLP pipeline: setting up conﬁguration, processing data with a tokenizer and encoder, and using a model either for training (adaptation in particular) or inference. The model implementations provided in the library follow the original computation graphs and are tested to ensure they match the original author implementations’ performances on various benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",

    "##### Easy-access and high-performance:\n",

    "    There is a growing ﬁeld of study, sometimes referred as BERTology from BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), concerned with investigating the inner working of large-scale pretrained models and trying to build a science on top of these empirical results.\n",

(2019) and (ii) providing diﬀerent models in a uniﬁed API to prevent overﬁtting to a speciﬁc architecture (and set of pretrained weights). Moreover, the uniﬁed front-end of the library makes it easy to compare the performances of several architectures on a common language understanding benchmark. Transformers notably includes pre-processors and ﬁne-tuning scripts for GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), SuperGLUE (Wang et al. (2019)) and SQuAD1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\n",

To accommodate a large community of practitioners and researchers, the library is deeply compatible with (and actually makes compatible) two major deep learning frameworks: PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and TensorFlow (from release 2.0) (Abadi et al., 2015). \n",

    "    Model - All models follow the same hierarchy of abstraction: a base class implements the model’s computation graph from encoding (projection on the embedding matrix) through the series of self-attention layers and up to the last layer hidden states. The base class is speciﬁc to each model and closely follows the original implementation, allowing users to dissect the inner workings of each individual architecture. Additional wrapper classes are built on top of the base class, adding a speciﬁc head on top of the base model hidden states.\n",
    "    All models are available both in PyTorch and TensorFlow (starting 2.0) and oﬀer deep inter-operability between both frameworks. For instance, a model trained in one of frameworks can be saved on drive for the standard library serialization practice and then be reloaded from the saved ﬁles in the other framework seamlessly, making it particularly easy to switch from one framework to the other one along the model life-time (training, serving, etc.)\n",

There are a total of four high-level abstractions referenced as Auto classes: AutoConfig, AutoTokenizer, AutoModel (for PyTorch) and TFAutoModel (for TensorFlow).

The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal task-specific parameters, and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre-trained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.\n",
